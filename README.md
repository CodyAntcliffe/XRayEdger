# Fracture Identification and Analysis using Edge Detection on an X-Ray Image
#Try it out! http://codyantcliffe.github.io/XRayEdger/

Instantly get the outline of any image!  

Although this works with any image, I figured that it would be really practical/helpful if it was used for X-Ray images.  

Edge detection, which can be used to determine irregularities
Bone separation distance/area
Break/fracture severity analysis
Show changes over time in order to estimate remaining recovery time.
Ability to handle both large and small fractures.
Estimate average healing time based on separation distance.

We will be implementing the 'jsfeat' 3rd party library (http://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat) in order to process the X-ray images and convert to a vector image.  From there, we will develop tools for determining how severe the fracture or break is.  

Focus will initially be on a specific bone/area which is common to injure, such as clavicle or wrist area.



IN PROGRESS

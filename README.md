# Fracture Identification and Analysis using Edge Detection on an X-Ray Image
#Try it out! http://codyantcliffe.github.io/XRayEdger/

Instantly get the outline of any image!  

Although this works with any image, I figured that it would be really practical/helpful if it was used for X-Ray images.  

- Edge detection, which can be used to determine irregularities. 
- Bone separation distance/area
- Break/fracture severity analysis
- Show changes over time in order to estimate remaining recovery time.
- Ability to handle both large and small fractures.
- Estimate average healing time based on separation distance.
